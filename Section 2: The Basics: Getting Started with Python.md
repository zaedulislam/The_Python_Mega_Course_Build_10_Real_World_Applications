# Section 2: The Basics: Getting Started with Python

- When we press the execute (`Run Python File in Terminal`) button in Python, Visual Studio Code executed the following two commands and it returns the output. So this is a terminal and this terminal here expects Windows commands. Both represent the same thing.

```
& C:/Users/islam/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python39/python.exe e:/WORKSTATION/Python/The_Basics/basics.py
```

```
py -3.9 e:/WORKSTATION/Python/The_Basics/basics.py
```

So this command here contains two parts:

1. The first part is this one in here. That is the path to the Python 3.9 interpreter. You can see here, 'python.exe', this is interpreted. So that button knows where this interpreter is because we have told Visual Studio Code that this is the interpreter we're using. So Sisual Studio code knows the path of that interpreter and gives that to Windows.


```
& C:/Users/islam/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python39/python.exe 
```

2. Then, we're providing the path to the file which contains the Python code.

```
e:/WORKSTATION/Python/The_Basics/basics.py
```
